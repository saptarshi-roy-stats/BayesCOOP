Description: Combines jittered group spike-and-slab LASSO regularization with intermediate fusion to enable integrative learning across multiple data modalities. For uncertainty quantification, BayesCOOP applies the Bayesian bootstrap to generate approximate posterior samples by performing maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation on jittered and resampled multimodal datasets. Currently, only continuous outcomes are supported.

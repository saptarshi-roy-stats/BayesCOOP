\title{Internal helper functions for BayesCOOP}
\description{
These helpers prepare multimodal data, filter features, construct augmented
design matrices for cooperative/consensus-style fusion, and fit weighted
spike-and-slab lasso models used inside \code{bayesCoop()} for Bayesian
bootstrap inference and MAP estimation.

These helpers prepare multimodal data, filter features, construct augmented
design matrices for multi-view fusion, and fit weighted spike-and-slab
models used internally by \code{bayesCoop()}.
